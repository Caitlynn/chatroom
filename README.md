this is a very simple ugly Readme of a very simple project..

It is a chatroom, so if you set up on localhost, you can have multiple browsers open and talking to each other.... the messages are saved if you don't restart your server

The frontend is in ReactJS and the backend is in Express.

The frontend is in the folder 'app' and the backend is in the folder 'api'.


--------------------set up--------------------------

To set up the frontend: run `npm install` then `npm start` from `/app`, it will be on 'localhost:3000'

To set up the backend: run `npm install` then `npm start` from `/api`, if you want to check backend messages, they are on 'localhost:8000/chatroom'



-------------------test doc--------------------------

Simple run `npm test` from `/app` for frontend tests and from `api` for backend tests.

Tests are kept in `__tests__` for the server and for the frontend each test for the component is kept within the component folder.


I am using jest for both testing :)
